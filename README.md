# Advent of Code :christmas_tree:

## Introduction
These are my solutions for **Advent of Code :christmas_tree:**. I have started doing these in 2021, using Python for two years, I am now using PowerShell since I wanted to test my actual skill, I am currently using PowerShell everyday in my line of work within Directory Services and I thought it would be a nice opportunity to learn more about this. As you can see in the table below, I never finish these due to lack of time, I am planning to redo every single one in PowerShell in near future starting from 2021 up to 2022.
