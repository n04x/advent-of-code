delimiter is '|'`

7 is the only digit that uses 3 segments (dab) in the example
	So if len(segments) == 3 then 7

4 is the only digit that uses 4 segments (eafb) in the example
	So if len(segments) == 4 then 4

1 is the only digit that uses 2 segment (cf) in the example
	So if len(segments) == 2 then 1

8 is the only digit that uses 7 segments (abcdefg) in the example
	So if len(segments) == 7 then 8

then we count how many time 1,4,7 or 8 appear
	sum(1,4,7,8)
