find the low points in a heightmap

how low points are calculated:
 a
bxc
 d
if x is the lowest value (x < a,b,c,d) then x is a low points

Also consider there might be only 3 or 2 neighbors
a        a
xc   and xb
b

Then we calculate the risk level which is 1 + its height
	1 + x

Each number -> height of a particular location from 0 -> 9
