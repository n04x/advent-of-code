# advent-of-code 2021

## Introduction
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. I chose **Python** version 3 as my weapon of choice.

### Day 01
The input value are separate by a blank line to determine the grouping of value for each elfs. Basically the code will have to sum value for each subsequent line until an empty line has reach. This will determine the total Calories of the elf. The objective of the first part is to find the highest value of the grouping in order to give him the snack first.

### Day 02
The input from enemy player are stored in the first column and the values are interpreted as following:
- `A` is for Rock
- `B` is for Paper
- `C` is for Scissor

The input from you are stored in the second column and the values are interpreted as following:
- `X` is for Rock
- `Y` is for Paper
- `Z` is for Scissor

The winner is determined by the highest score and the score are interpreted as following:
`Type + Outcome`
The type score are determined as following:
- 1 for Rock
- 2 for Paper
- 3 for Scissor
The outcome score are determined as following:
- 3 for draw
- 0 for loss
- 6 for win

### Day 03
The elves made some mistake with rumsacks, first we need to define a function to split the rumsacks by two (compartments) in order to find the error. The error is the value that appear in **both** compartments, we then add up all value found based on their priority. For the second part, we groups each rumsack in a group of 3 and we found the repeated letter that appear in each rumsack and determine it as the missing badge. We then add the priority value to get the answer.
